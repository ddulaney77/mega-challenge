# Code Adventure SASS Rainbow

### Way to go Randy Layne for creating this weeks Code Adventure!


Create a CSS Rainbow using SASS in this fun Code Adventure! Use SASS
to change the colors of the rainbow.


## Getting started

1. Open up index.html file
  - There's some HTML starter code with the unordered list and list
    items for the rainbow.

2. Open up the styles.css file inside the css folder
  - This is the starter code that creates the rainbow in css.

3. Preview the webpage
  - You should see an awesome rainbow. Your goal is to create the
    same thing, but instead of using css, use SCSS.

4. Open up the styles.scss file inside the scss folder
  - Add your SCSS styles to this file to create the SASS rainbow.


## How to compile your SASS

- run `sass --watch scss:css` in the terminal
  - Make sure that you change the directory to the scss folder and
    then run the command above.


## Take this project further

-Create a mixin and some color variables, and use them to change
  the colors of the rainbow.
### OR
-Use Sass maps and loops to change the colors of the rainbow.


--------------------------------------------------------------------


The SASS documentation has a lot of reference material available
[here]([https://sass-lang.com/guide]). And of course you are always
encouraged to discuss the challenge among your fellow developers in
Slack, if you need some help getting pointed in the right direction.

Feel free to modify the actual colors used should you wish to change
them out for your own custom colors or add other effects if you'd
like, as long as the outputted selectors are the same and each bar is
a different color.

Good luck and happy coding!

# Code Adventure Information Card

Create an information card in this fun Code Adventure. We've provided a mockup
for you to follow, or if you're up to the challenge, create your own layout and
styles. Feel free to add whatever you'd like to this information card - whether
it is HTML, CSS, or JavaScript functionality.

## Getting started


1. Review the mockup.png file
  - This mockup is for those who want a visual representation to follow along
    with. You are more than welcome to add your own styling and layout.

2. Review the images inside of the images folder
  - These are some starter images from what I used in the mockup. Feel free to add
    your own images for this awesome adventure.

2. Open up index.html file
  - There's some HTML stater code for you to start off with. Go ahead and add the
    HTML for the information card here.

3. Open the style.css file inside the css folder
  - Add your styles to this file to make this information card look sweet. I went
    ahead and linked the stylesheet to the HTML.  


## Tasks

- Add HTML elements to the index.html file

- Style your information card by adding CSS to the style.css file


### Take this project further

If you want to do even more, here are a couple of ideas to expand on this code
adventure
- Add a CSS hover effect when the information card is hovered over
- Add a CSS transition effect with hover effect
- Add JavaScript functionality to the information card
  - Ex. Add a next arrow. when the arrow is clicked, replace the current members
   information with a new member
